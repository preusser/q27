# The Q27 Project

The Q27 Project is a showcase for a massively parallel computation to tackle
an otherwise infeasible problem. It demonstrates the tremendous computational
power of designated circuit designs implemented on FPGA accelerators at the
example of enumerating and couting all the valid solutions of the
27-[Queens Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).
